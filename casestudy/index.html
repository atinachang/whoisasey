				<h3>Introduction:</h3> 
				<p>
					As a grad fresh out of bootcamp, I not only wanted to reach greater audiences, but I wanted to work towards a larger goal - experience. Most new grads immediately look for paid work on boards, listings, forums. While sometimes effective, it may not yield the results that are satisfying for growth. 
				</p>
				<p>So, how can I gain experience with a greater audience, but is also satisfying?</p>
				
			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>The Challenge:</h3>
				<p>
					As a DJ in a creative community, I know how daunting it can be to get a website up and running, especially in a way that reflects your personality and your own unique brand. With the numerous platforms out there, its overwhelming to know where to start. I never had a website until I built one myself this year, after learning how to become a Front End Developer. The creative community is constantly evolving day by day, with more portfolios appearing across multiple platforms by the minute. 
				</p>
				<p>Finally, a way to help out members of my community while gaining experience at the same time.</p>

			</div>

			<div>
				<h3>The Solution:</h3>
				<p>I created a contest to create three free websites. This came from a need for my fellow creatives and members of the community to have a platform of their own to share. Through this contest, I was able to not only reach a greater audience, but officially let my community know I was open for business as a Front End Developer.</p>
				<!-- <h6>Strategy</h6> -->
				<p>Once I had my entries, I built my own <em>Vanilla JS "Countdown Timer & HTML Reveal"</em> winner selector - which you can see on my Medium <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/building-a-simple-countdown-timer-and-html-reveal-with-vanilla-javascript-411bc8d863af">here</a>. It was important to me to not only practice my skills, but to also be transparent to my community. By showing my exact steps on how I selected my winners, I could show that the selection was random and fair to everyone. I shared this on my social media as my announcement for the contest. </p>
				<!-- <h6>The Clients</h6> -->
				<p>
				By spending a month with each client, I was able to uncover how they wanted to share their vision to their community. I had originally planned to make static sites for my clients. But to offer myself and the clients more flexibility, decided dynamic sites with a CMS-platform would be best based on their needs.
				</p>

				<!-- <span>Client 1</span>
				<p>The first client I had was a local photographer. He had his previous website on a CMS platform, but was limited to the styling.</p>
				<p>I built all the functionality of his previous CMS and a photo gallery with just HTML, CSS, and jQuery. </p>
				<p>

				</p> -->

				<!-- <span>Client 2</span>
				<p>The second clients I had were friends and business partners, passionate in creating specialty wedding experiences that highlighted African culture.</p>
				<p>They didn't have a previous website, but like many businesses who don't know where to begin, had a domain and a subscription to a CMS-platform collecting internet dust.</p>
				<p>Since they wanted a website, community platform and eventually an online shop, I switched them over to Shopify.</p>
				<p>This one was a challenge, as it was my very first time designing a Shopify site from beginning to end. I spent the first two weeks of the month getting over the learning hump, and the last two weeks putting content together on the site. Luckily for me, the functionality was already built into the paltform, so what I really focused on was styling and design of the site, with minimal coding tweaks.</p>

				<!-- <span>Client 3</span>
				<p>My last and final client was also a photographer. What I love about people in the creative industry is that even though they may be in the same field, but their needs and wants in a website are totally different. </p>
				<p>For this client, it was his very first website. So it was like teaching a child how to ride a bike for the first time - setting up his domain, email and finally his CMS-platform. Since he wanted a site to showcase his portfolio and constantly add new work, we went with Wordpress.</p>
				<p>This one was a walk in the park after the Shopify one! This was also my first time designing and developing a Wordpress site from beginning to end. Lucky for me, my client had the skeleton of a website he made in a university web design class, so it was really easy to transfer those visions over into a multi-page functioning site.</p>
				<p>I kept most of the PHP functionality, with a few custom built functions.</p>

				<h3>The Results:</h3>
				<li>The biggest thing I took away from working on all three projects is - understanding your scope & bandwidth! I now know exactly how long it will take me to build each type of site, how to manage my time wisely.  </li>
				<li>Communication with clients is super key. No matter if you are a freelance developer or working with a company, it's inevitable! In addition, understanding what you absolutely cannot do, and communicating that, is very important.</li>
				<li>My audience has grown. I have more people who can refer my services to others. I was able to increase my network reach by 60%, and 80% of contest applicants were from outside my initial network.</li>

				<p>If you are a new graduate, I absolutely recommend offering your services for free to those in your community who might need it the most. At this point in your career, it's okay to take the L, because the experience is worth it.</p>
